# project.json schema changes

All additive (optional fields only), per docs/architecture.md section 3. Schema: `engine/reelengine/schema/project.schema.json`.

## 2026-10-17 (engine-core, A1)

- `sources[].rotation`: defined as the CLOCKWISE degrees (0/90/180/270) the stored picture must be turned
  to display upright. An upright iPhone portrait MOV stored as 1920x1080 has `rotation: 90`.
- `sources[].originalName` (string), `sources[].hdr` (bool): optional, written by `init`.
- `transcript.model` (string): which speech model produced the transcript.
- `cut.source` (string): who wrote the cut (`autocut` | `ai` | `user`).
- `captions.style.outlineColor` (`#RRGGBB`), `captions.style.shadow` (number): optional style knobs.
- `captions.style.size` is in 1080-wide units (scaled for other widths).
- `captions.hidden`: optional list of word-id ranges whose captions are suppressed (e.g. under a
  full-frame card).
- `transcript.json` words may carry `ws`/`we` (whisper's raw times), `p` (probability) and `gaps`
  (silent runs inside the word). `s`/`e` are the MEASURED edges every module should use.
  It also has `segments[{source,s,e,text,from,to}]` and `nextId`.
- Unknown extra fields anywhere are allowed (the schema does not set `additionalProperties: false`).

## 2026-10-20 (0.1.2 F2, note attachments)

- `notes[].attachments` (array of project-relative paths, at most 4): the files the user attached to that
  note, each a `work/assets/attach-<8 hex>-<stem>.<ext>` written by engine `attach`, with a sidecar
  `<asset>.attach.json` next to it (`asset`, `name`, `kind` image|video, `bytes`, `width`, `height`,
  `duration`, `hasAudio`, `fromGif`, `thumb`, `createdAt`). The sidecar is not part of project.json. A note
  may have empty `text` when it has attachments.

## 2026-10-21 (staged AI notes)

- `notes[].txnId` is an optional string identifying the staged note that published
  this version. Older note entries remain valid. The version snapshot contains it
  before publication; the live note list receives it after the project commit.
