# project.json schema changes

All additive (optional fields only), per docs/architecture.md section 3. Schema: `engine/reelengine/schema/project.schema.json`.

## 2026-10-17 (engine-core, A1)

- `sources[].rotation`: defined as the CLOCKWISE degrees (0/90/180/270) the stored picture must be turned
  to display upright. An upright iPhone portrait MOV stored as 1920x1080 has `rotation: 90`.
- `sources[].originalName` (string), `sources[].hdr` (bool): optional, written by `init`.
- `transcript.model` (string): which speech model produced the transcript.
- `cut.source` (string): who wrote the cut (`autocut` | `ai` | `user`).
- `captions.style.outlineColor` (`#RRGGBB`), `captions.style.shadow` (number): optional style knobs.
- `captions.style.size` is in 1080-wide units (scaled for other widths).
- `captions.hidden`: optional list of word-id ranges whose captions are suppressed (e.g. under a
  full-frame card).
- `transcript.json` words may carry `ws`/`we` (whisper's raw times), `p` (probability) and `gaps`
  (silent runs inside the word). `s`/`e` are the MEASURED edges every module should use.
  It also has `segments[{source,s,e,text,from,to}]` and `nextId`.
- Unknown extra fields anywhere are allowed (the schema does not set `additionalProperties: false`).

## 2026-10-20 (0.1.2 F2, note attachments)

- `notes[].attachments` (array of project-relative paths, at most 4): the files the user attached to that
  note, each a `work/assets/attach-<8 hex>-<stem>.<ext>` written by engine `attach`, with a sidecar
  `<asset>.attach.json` next to it (`asset`, `name`, `kind` image|video, `bytes`, `width`, `height`,
  `duration`, `hasAudio`, `fromGif`, `thumb`, `createdAt`). The sidecar is not part of project.json. A note
  may have empty `text` when it has attachments.

## 2026-10-20 (mirror)

- `sources[].mirror` (boolean, absent = false): the take is mirrored (a front-camera selfie: posters, shirts and
  signs read backwards), so the engine flips the picture left to right. The flip is the LAST step of the face
  picture's chain (after crop, scale and the upright turn) in both the software and the CUDA draft path, so the
  crop window is the same and the output is its mirror image. B-roll, zooms and captions are drawn on top and are
  never flipped; every reader of the face box in output pixels mirrors x (`x' = W - x - w`). Written by the AI's
  `set_mirror` tool and by the "Flip picture (it's mirrored)" toggle in "Edit it myself"; turning it off removes
  the field, so the project matches one that never had it.

## 2026-10-22 (caption presets)

- `captions.style.highlight` (`#RRGGBB`, no alpha, absent = none): the word being spoken is drawn in this colour, one
  word at a time. Each word is lit from its start until the next word starts. A line whose text lost a token
  (a word that was only punctuation) is drawn without the highlight.
- `captions.style.pop` (boolean, absent = false): each line grows from 80% to full size over its first 120 ms,
  carrying on across the word events of a highlighted line.
- `captions.style.preset` names the look the line started from in "Edit it myself" (`clean`, `bold-pop`,
  `karaoke`, `boxed`, `minimal`). The engine draws only the style fields; the name is for the picker.
